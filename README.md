Repository for my Mobile Applications 2 Project - An alcoholic drink unit calculator.

#Installation and Running from GitHub:

In order to use this application you should familiarise yourself with GitHub git commands:
https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/

#Application Description:

This application is a replica of multiple alcohol unit calculators, which intake multiple values (Such as name, age, gender, drinks, etc...)
and display them back to the user with their standard drink intake, for reference.

#Why calculate units of alcohol?

With drinking virtually engrained in Irish culture it's easy to ignore how much alcohol you actually intake. With an app such as this a user can
easily reference their alcohol intake for the night vs their weekly reference intake.

#Design:

The app is designed around a robust pivot system which utilizes it's light footprint and seamless transitions, giving the impression of much more content.
